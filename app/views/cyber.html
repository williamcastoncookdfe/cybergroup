    <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">The importance of meeting the standard</h2>
<p>Being unprepared for a cyber attack can lead to:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>poor decisions</li>
  <li>slow recovery</li>
  <li>expensive mistakes</li>
</ul>
<p>A good response plan made ahead of time will:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>reduce stress levels</li>
  <li>increase response speed</li>
  <li>reduce confusion</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">How to meet the standard</h2>
<p>Talk to your IT service provider and make sure you have a cyber attack contingency plan. The plan must be part of your business continuity and disaster recovery plan.</p>
<p>The institution’s governors should oversee the creation and testing of these plans.</p>
<p>The National Cyber Security Centre provides guidance on:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/about-ncsc/incident-management">incident management</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/caf/caf-principles-and-guidance/d-1-response-and-recovery-planning">response and recovery planning</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To help with testing, they also provide <a rel="external" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/exercise-in-a-box">an exercise kit</a>.</p>
<p>Your IT service provider may be a staff technician or an external service provider.</p>
<p>Remember that this standard may change over time with changing cyber threats.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Technical requirements to meet the standard</h2>
<p>All schools and colleges  must include a contingency plan for loss of some or all IT systems in their business continuity and disaster recovery plan. This is required by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/schools-financial-value-standard-sfvs/2019-to-2020-checklist-guidance">Schools financial value standard</a>.</p>
<p>This plan must include:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>staff responsibilities</li>
  <li>out of hours contacts and procedures</li>
  <li>internal and external reporting and communications plans</li>
  <li>priorities for service restoration</li>
  <li>the minimum operational IT requirements</li>
  <li>where you can find additional help and resources</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep hard copies of key information in case of total system failure.</p>
<p>Test and review these plans regularly.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Dependencies to the standard</h2>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">When to meet the standard</h2>
<p>You should be meeting this standard as soon as possible.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">The importance of meeting the standard</h2>
<p>Cyber attacks are crimes against a school that need to be investigated so perpetrators can be found and counter-measures identified.</p>
<p>A cyber attack is defined as an intentional and unauthorised attempt to access or compromise the data, hardware or software on a computer network or system.</p>
<p>The National Cyber Security Centre <a rel="external" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/what-cyber-incident">define what a cyber incident is</a>.</p>
<p>This compromise of data might include:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>stealing the data</li>
  <li>copying the data</li>
  <li>tampering with the data</li>
  <li>damaging the data, or similar</li>
  <li>unauthorised access</li>
</ul>
<p>You should report any suspicious cyber incident to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or <a rel="external" href="https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/reporting-fraud-and-cyber-crime">https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/reporting-fraud-and-cyber-crime</a></p>
<p>Police investigations may find out if any compromised data has been published or sold and identify the perpetrator.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">How to meet the standard</h2>
<p>Ask your IT service provider to notify the school leadership team (SLT) of all cyber attacks. Appropriate action and information-sharing must be carried out in accordance with <a rel="external" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</a></p>
<p>These incidents should also be reported to the DfE sector Cyber team at <a href="mailto:Sector.Incidentreporting@education.gov.uk">Sector.Incidentreporting@education.gov.uk</a> .</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Technical requirements to meet the standard</h2>
<p>Schools and colleges must report cyber attacks to:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

</ul>
<p>and where applicable:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">The importance of meeting the standard</h2>
<p>The protection of sensitive and personal data is vital to:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>the safety of staff and students</li>
  <li>the reputation of schools and colleges</li>
  <li>the confidence placed in schools and colleges</li>
  <li>avoid the legal liabilities which security breaches expose schools and colleges to</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">How to meet the standard</h2>
<p>You should control access to data in consultation with your IT service provider. This is to safeguard staff and students as required by the <a rel="external" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</a></p>
<p>To meet the standard, you must:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>assess the risk of compromise, and the degree of damage caused by a security compromise, to work out the resources required to protect the data</li>
  <li>pseudonymize or encrypt any personal data while stored and in transit to a third party</li>
  <li>ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data and systems processing them</li>
  <li>restore complete and accurate data after an incident in a timely fashion</li>
  <li>design and apply processes for testing and assessing the effectiveness of all measures used to safeguard data and its use</li>
</ul>
<p>There is DfE guidance on:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-trust-financial-management-good-practice-guides/academy-trust-risk-management">academy trust risk management</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-protection-toolkit-for-schools">data protection toolkit</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Technical requirements to meet the standard</h2>
<p>Academy trusts should incorporate the risk assessment into the risk register.</p>
<p>If you rely upon encryption, this should be:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>strong encryption</li>
  <li>using encryption systems that are not yet broken</li>
  <li>with a life appropriate to the sensitivity of the data being stored</li>
</ul>
<p>The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) provides <a rel="external" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/security/encryption/">advice on how data encryption should be used</a>.</p>
<p>Additional protection or password protection should meet the technical requirements in Standard 3.</p>
<p>You should limit access to those staff with a specific need. Do this by specific content area, and not blanket permissions.</p>
<p>By achieving all the cyber standards you can meet the additional requirements for:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>confidentiality</li>
  <li>integrity</li>
  <li>availability</li>
  <li>restoration</li>
