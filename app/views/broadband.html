<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Importance of meeting the standard</h2>
<p> Full fibre services provide the capacity and speed needed for effective use of online learning tools.

Getting the fastest speed you can afford has a wide range of benefits including:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>increasing the use of online digital resources and media to support teaching</li>
<li>enabling pupils and teachers to access learning away from the school (FTTP)</li>
</ul>

<p>Full fibre services provide flexibility to future proof schools and colleges as demand for internet services increases.</p>


<p>The connection can also be dedicated to your school and the speeds guaranteed.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">How to meet the standard</h2>

<p> You should ask your supplier or in-house support team to investigate the availability of full fibre broadband services and speeds.<br><br>

Primary schools should have a minimum 100Mbps download speed and a minimum of 30Mbps upload speed.<br><br>

Secondary schools, all-through schools and further education colleges should have a minimum 1Gbps download and upload speed.
<br></br>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Technical requirements to meet the standard</h2>
<p> Broadband should be provided using a full fibre connection.<br><br>
  Full fibre connections are sometimes described as:
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>a leased line</li>
  <li>fibre to the premises (FTTP)</li>
  </ul>

  <p> Note: copper connections, while widely used in schools at present, do not meet this standard.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Dependencies to the standard</h2>

  <p> The speed of your internet services may vary depending on your:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>internal network cabling and switches</li>
  <li>internal network equipment such as routers and wireless access points</li><br>
  </ul>

  <p> See our other standards on wireless networks, cabling and switches.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">When to meet the standard</h2>

<p> You should be looking to implement this standard as soon as practicable and as soon as full fibre is available. This is usually at the end of any existing contract term.<br><br>

Ensure that any new contracts/contract extensions using non-standard full fibre connection types provide the opportunity to change to faster connections services as soon as possible when they become available.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Importance of meeting the standard</h2>
<p> With increasing reliance on internet-based services, broadband internet is an essential service. You should ensure that appropriate measures are in place to mitigate against a single point of failure.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">How to meet the standard</h2>
<p> You should investigate which backup internet services are available in their area and implement appropriate systems.<br><br>

Your broadband provider will be able to advise on possible solutions and costs.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Technical requirements to meet the standard</h2>
<p> This standard requires a combination of the following:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>multiple broadband connection services (of different service types)</li>
<li>multiple routers and appropriate associated router programming to provide automatic failover to backup services as and when required</li>
<li>redundant power options on core active network equipment</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">When to meet the standard</h2>

<p> Resilient services should be implemented alongside, or as soon as possible after fast full fibre broadband.</p>

    <p> It’s essential that children are safeguarded from potentially harmful and inappropriate online material. An effective whole school and college approach to online safety empowers a school or college to protect and educate pupils, students, and staff in their use of technology. It establishes ways to identify, intervene in, and escalate any concerns where appropriate.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">How to meet the standard</h2>
<p> You should talk to your supplier or in-house support team to ensure that you have a content filtering system in place which meets the requirements outlined in the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1021914/KCSIE_2021_September_guidance.pdf#page=33"> online safety section of Keeping Children Safe in Education, paragraphs 123-135.</a href><br><br>

You should also ensure that you have a firewall as part of IT internet and network system. This could be an on premise device directly protecting your network and directly managed by the school or college. It also might be an ‘edge’ service provided and managed by your supplier or in-house support team.
